- We employ a compact network for character recognition. 
- The compact network used in our task combines the depthwise separable convolutions, inverted residual blocks and non-linear activation functions, in order to balance the computation reduction and recognition accuracy. 
- Additionally, we apply hybrid augmentation method to enhance the robustness of the model.
