The uncommon Chinese characters appear in various historical documents and poetry. People tend to use optical character recognition tools to understand incomprehensible characters. The current Chinese text recognition interface is restricted to a fixed character set, such as GB2312-80 and GB18010-2005 standard (6,763 and 27,533 Chinese characters respectively). However, the second version of HanYu Dictionary contains over 55K characters. In this paper, we build a HanYu Dictionary Database (HYDDB) for character recognition research. The dataset is built by cropping character images from the dictionary category, and it consists of 55,036 character categories. The compact network use depthwise separable convolutions and residual connections to achieve the real-time inference speed and acceptable accuracy at the same time. So we employ a compact network for large-scale characters classification on mobile devices and hybrid augmentation methods for providing sufficient character samples in the training stage. The experiment demonstrates that our adaptive network for medium-resolution images achieves nearly 99\% for top-1 accuracy on the HYDDB, which shows practical values in developing real-world applications.
